    <h3>What is this mod supposed to do?</h3>
    <p>
    That is fairly simple.
    This mod's aims to help you calculate an estimate lowballing price in trades.
    This will help your head from thinking alot.
    Also the mod will grant a feature to check how much an item on the auction house is cheaper from it's total value.

    <h3> Is this a rat? </h3>
    <p>
    I do not intend to rat/scam/trick any community to get me ahead in a video game.
    If you really think it's a rat, you can go through the code (incase you have the skills)
    or just don't download it. I'm not forcing this upon anyone.
    It's just a fun project im working on to learn more about java.
